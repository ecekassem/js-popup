# js-popup
A pure JavaScript function for making pop-ups with customization of sub-screen size/location, box size, styles and of course various contents. 
This function considers the whole window as the main screen, and it is left to the designer to cutomize the sub-screen that will hold the popup box.
The sub-screen concept was not generated to complicate the popup matter but rather for giving the facility to locate the popup box in anywhere within the window boundries (i.e. instead of being poped up only in the center of the screen!).
